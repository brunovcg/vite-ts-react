# Antigravity Rule: Strict Icons Creation

1 - src/components/icon/Icons.tsx renders all icons we have in src/components/icons/assets

2 - Create the icons inside assets, it should be a svg like all others

3 - src/components/icon/icons.ts holds the mapping of the icons we have

2 - Check src/components/icon/\* to get full context
