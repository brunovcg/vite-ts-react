# Antigravity Rule: Strict Typing Enforcement

## 🚨 Core Instruction: Eliminate `any`

The following rule is MANDATORY for all TypeScript and TSX files generated by the agent.

1.  **NEVER** use the TypeScript type `any` for variables, function parameters, function return values, component props, or state definitions.

2.  **Required Alternatives:**
    - **For Component Props:** Always define a specific interface or type alias (e.g., `interface Props { userId: number; }`).
    - **For State:** Use specific types (e.g., `number`, `string`, `MyObjectType[]`) or define a `type` or `interface` for complex objects.
    - **When Types are Unknown (LAST RESORT ONLY):** Use `unknown` instead of `any`. When using `unknown`, the agent **must** implement runtime type checking (e.g., type assertions or narrowing) before accessing properties.

3.  **Third-Party Libraries:** If a third-party library's types are missing, the agent must create and include a local declaration file (`d.ts`) with the required types, rather than defaulting to `any`.

## 🛑 Self-Correction

If, during the verification or test phase, the agent detects a file using `any`, it must immediately pause, flag the violation in the agent log, and perform a self-correction refactoring to replace the `any` usage with a proper, specific type definition.
