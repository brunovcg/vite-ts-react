# Antigravity Rule: Strict Typing Enforcement

## 🚨 Core Instruction: Do not install third party libs, we have a own code policy.

The following rule is MANDATORY for all TypeScript and TSX files generated by the agent.

1.  **NEVER** install a third party library, always do the code using the components, hooks, helpers, utils we have.

2.  If needed, ask to create new components, hooks, helpers etc.
